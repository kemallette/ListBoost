ListBoost
=========
ListView and ExpandableListView are quite powerful and fundamental to most apps. Unfortunately, they are also the source for many headaches and face palms. Iâ€™m not ashamed to admit spending more than a couple evenings staring angrily at misbehaving lists and adapters. If you are familiar with ExpandableListView, you have probably noticed that it is missing some features (such as choice modes) compared to its parent, ListView. Additionally, you have probably noticed that both ListView and ExpandableListView can be a pain to implement for use cases that fall outside of using a simple adapter and built in list item views. The aim for ListBoost is to implement some much needed _new_ functionality as well as to add conveniences where possible without requiring users to implement complicated wrappers or extra boilerplate.
